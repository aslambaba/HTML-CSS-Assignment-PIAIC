        <p class="firstP">Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing (PIAIC) is a privatly funded
            not-for-profit educational Initiative started by president of Pakistan, Dr Arif Alvi, Kazi rehat ali,
            and Zia Khan to help promote education, research, business  oppertunities in emerging tech fields like

        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="Headings"><b>C</b>loud Native Computing</h2>
        <p class="secondP">The <b>Could Native Computing</b> program prepare the student to program in open source technologies
            like <b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i></b> while introducing
            the students to developent of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platform
            like AWS.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="Headings">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="secondP">The<b> Artificial Intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student throught
        foundation of AI technology, via teaching programming in open-source-language like
         <b><i>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0, and Flask</i></b> and teaching deploying AI solutions
        and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="Headings">Blockchain</h2>
        <p class="secondP">The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains
        like <b><i>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity,
        JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to deployement of 
        Distrubuted Apps (DApps), Frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-Service
        (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto token.
        </p>

        <h2 class='Headings'>Internet of Things:</h2>
        <p class="secondP">The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduce the student to open source development
        technologies like <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
        and Kubernetes</i></b> while making them efficent in developing Micro Services for IOT-Edge,
        IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
